## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0]
- Add an ability to configure subscription graceful shutdown timeout globally and per subscription. Default value is 15 seconds. Previously it was hardcoded to 5 seconds. Examples:

```ruby
# Set it globally, for all subscriptions
PgEventstore.configure do |config|
  config.subscription_graceful_shutdown_timeout = 5
end

# Set it per subscription
subscriptions_manager.subscribe(
  'MySubscriptionWithHeavyLiftingTask',
  handler: proc { |event| puts event },
  graceful_shutdown_timeout: 20
)
```

## [1.3.4]
- Fix `NoMethodError` error in `Client#read_paginated` when stream does not exist or when there are no events matching the given filter

## [1.3.3]
- Adjust default value of `subscription_max_retries` setting

## [1.3.2]
- Fix UI when switching subscription status

## [1.3.1]
- Swap "Search" button and "Add filter" button on Dashboard page

## [1.3.0]
- Add ability to filter subscriptions by state in admin UI
- Reset error-related subscription's attributes on subscription restore
- Reset total processed events number when user changes subscription's position
- Allow to search event type, stream context and stream name by substring in web UI
- Relax sinatra version requirement to v3+

## [1.2.0]
- Implement `failed_subscription_notifier` subscription hook.

Now you are able to define a function that is called when subscription fails and no longer can be automatically restarted because it hit max number of retries. You can define the hook globally in the config and per subscription. Examples:

```ruby
PgEventstore.configure do |config|
  config.failed_subscription_notifier = proc { |sub, error| puts "Subscription: #{sub.inspect}, error: #{error.inspect}" }
end

subscriptions_manager = PgEventstore.subscriptions_manager(subscription_set: 'MyApp')
# Overrides config.failed_subscription_notifier function
subscriptions_manager.subscribe(
  'My Subscription 1',
  handler: Handler.new('My Subscription 1'),
  options: { filter: { event_types: ['Foo'] } },
  failed_subscription_notifier: proc { |_subscription, err| p err }
)
# Uses config.failed_subscription_notifier function
subscriptions_manager.subscribe(
  'My Subscription 2',
  handler: Handler.new('My Subscription 2'),
  options: { filter: { event_types: ['Bar'] } }
)
```
