module PgEventstore
  # Implements simple background job runner. A job execution is done via declaring a callback on a specific action. The
  # implementation also allows you to hook into different places of life cycle of the runner by defining callbacks on
  # various actions. Here is the list of available actions:
  # - :before_runner_started. Happens before the runner's state switches from "initial"/"stopped" to "running" and
  #   runner's thread is started. It is also fired when the runner is restoring - right after :before_runner_restored
  #   action.
  # - :after_runner_stopped. Happens after runner's state got switched from "running"/"dead" to "stopped" and runner's
  #   thread is terminated.
  # - :before_runner_restored. Happens before runner's state gets switched from "dead" to "running" and runner's
  #   thread is started.
  # - :process_async. Happens each @run_interval seconds within runner's thread.
  # - :after_runner_died. Happens when runner's state switches to "dead" because of exception inside runner's thread.
  #   Callback function must be able to accept one argument - the exception which caused the runner to die will be
  #   passed.
  # - :change_state. It happens each time the runner changes the state. Callback function must be able to accept one
  #   argument - current state will be passed.
  #
